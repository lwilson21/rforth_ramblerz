# Current TODO: 

- test: can push one stack value and print it
- test: all stack methods can be used (1 line input, print correct result, quit)
- test: multiple lines of input, "bye" exits
- implement: variables. 
    - creation: "variable var" (start with this line creating an object & verifying it exists)
    - storage: "12 var !" (ensure variable objects can store an integer)
    - program searches for stored vars in user input (program can recall down the line that var is a valid token meaning 12)

## Lee:
- initial c++ scans DONE

## Emilie
- int_stack.cpp
    - pop, top, print, lessthan DONE
    - int_stack.hpp DONE


# Old

Intermediate Deadline 1 (April 15): 

Overall: functional stack with a few stack operators

Create README.md and update TODO section - Done 

Translate key stack management methods to C++:
- Lee: init, push, size
- Emilie: pop, top, print, capacity
- Some of these stack operators implemented: dup, swap, over, rot, drop, 2swap, 2drop, 2dup, 2over. Ideally at least dup, swap, over, rot, drop
- together- discuss how to implement classes into code
