TODO: 
Intermediate Deadline 1 (April 15): 

Overall: functional stack with a few stack operators

Create README.md and update TODO section - Done 

Translate key stack management methods to C++:
- Lee: init, push, size
- Emilie: pop, top, print, capacity
- Some of these stack operators implemented: dup, swap, over, rot, drop, 2swap, 2drop, 2dup, 2over. Ideally at least dup, swap, over, rot, drop
- together- discuss how to implement classes into code


Notes for Emilie from Lee:
- currently stack stores values in an array where arr[0] = first object in stack. we can change this if need be
- in terms of naming conventions it looks like C++ is similar to Java, so I name methods like exampleMethod() and variables like exampleVariable.
