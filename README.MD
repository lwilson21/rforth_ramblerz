TODO: 
Intermediate Deadline 1 (April 15): 

Overall: functional stack with a few stack operators
Create README.md and update TODO section - Done 
Translate key stack management methods to C++:
Lee: init, push, size
Emilie: pop, top, print, capacity
Some of these stack operators implemented: dup, swap, over, rot, drop, 2swap, 2drop, 2dup, 2over. Ideally at least dup, swap, over, rot, drop
